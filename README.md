# ClipGrid

This is a vibe-coding project. I do not plan to review pull requests or handle issues for this repository.

ClipGrid is a native macOS app built with SwiftUI that imports multiple videos and exports a video preview image for each one as `JPG` or `PNG`.

## Features

The most important capabilities in the current version are:

- Multi-file import via drag and drop or file picker
- Contact sheet style video preview export with timestamps on every thumbnail
- Configurable grid, thumbnail size, spacing, colors, metadata visibility, and font sizes
- Built-in `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` for broader format support such as `mkv`, `avi`, and `webm`
- Universal macOS app bundle for Apple Silicon and Intel
- Persistent settings across app restarts
- German and English localization
- One-click render and export for all loaded videos
- Light and dark placeholder preview artwork that follows the current macOS appearance

## Requirements

- macOS 13 or newer
- Xcode Command Line Tools or Xcode with Swift 6

## Development

```bash
swift build
swift run
```

You can also open `Package.swift` directly in Xcode.

## Project Structure

- `Sources/ClipGrid`: SwiftUI app, view models, renderer, and services
- `Sources/ClipGrid/Resources`: localized `Localizable.strings` and preview placeholder artwork
- `Resources/Info.plist`: bundle metadata for the packaged app
- `Scripts/build-ffmpeg.sh`: builds bundled `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` binaries from the official FFmpeg source
- `Scripts/package-app.sh`: builds the native `.app` bundle
- `icon.png`: source image for the app icon

## Build the App Bundle

```bash
bash Scripts/build-ffmpeg.sh
bash Scripts/package-app.sh
```

After that, the native macOS app will be available at `dist/ClipGrid.app`.

## Running an Unnotarized Build

If macOS blocks the app because it is not notarized, use one of these methods:

1. Move `ClipGrid.app` to `Applications`.
2. In Finder, right-click the app and choose `Open`.
3. Confirm the security dialog with `Open`.

Alternatively:

1. Open `System Settings > Privacy & Security`.
2. Scroll to the security section after a blocked launch attempt.
3. Allow the app to open anyway, then launch it again.

## Notes

- The app icon is generated from `icon.png` during packaging.
- `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are bundled inside the app, so no separate installation is required.
- Exported images use the same base filename as the video, with the selected image extension.
